						<h3> "I want to be a developer who makes websites with logic, artistry, and love." </h3>
				<p> Sarah feels that web development and design is a great fit for her, because it complements many positive traits in her personality. She loves to be creative, and enjoys making beautiful things. Web development is an art, and the design process is not always an easy task. The challenges that both designing and developing bring to the table really allow her to use her critical thinking skills, and she thoroughly enjoys the challenge. But more than all this, Sarah loves the fact that she can help others achieve their dreams by being a web developer. </p>
						<p> Sarah also enjoys many activities outside the field of the net. Her favorite pastimes include cooking, drawing, gaming, reading, writing, and spending time with family and friends. She also is working to become fluent in Spanish and has been studying the language for 6 years. For her work in Spanish she received a Certificate of Multilingual Proficiency from the State of Indiana in 2017.

                    <p class="thumbText"> This pretend tutoring site was inspired by Sarah's partner, Jacob Kopis, a student studying the Tuba at Indiana University's Jacobs School of Music. The intent was to create an innovative way to advertise tutoring lessons and to give prospective students an idea of what the tutoring would entail. While not in active use today, a revised version may be used for real students in the future. This site was designed and developed in January 2019.</p>
