                    <h3> Hi There! My name is Jacob -</h3>
                    <p>- And I love playing tuba! I started with it in middle school and never stopped. I recently graduated from Indiana University Bloomington's Jacobs School of Music with a Bachelor's in Music for tuba performance. Even though my academic career is complete, I'm always looking for more opportunities to play music.</p>
                    <p>I like to perform all types of music from all over the world. I love learning about all kinds of instruments, from the niche edges of modern music culture to the traditional instruments found around the globe. </p>
                    <p> These days, I am active in the Martinsville Community Band that I first joined when I was in middle school. Every Christmas, I attend at least one local Tuba Christmas to celebrate the season. I often practice in local parks and invite my friends over for a good jam session. I have started uploading bi-weekly tuba videos on my <a href="https://instagram.com/jacobkopis" target="_blank">Instagram </a>to show what different types of music can be played on tuba.</p>
                    <p> Outside of music, I enjoy retro video games, drawing, and spending time with my close family and friends. I love to go out in nature and experience the outdoors (which is why you'll see many of my recordings are done outside!) I currently live in Waverly, IN with my <a href="https://sjkweb.com" target="_blank"> lovely wife </a>who made this awesome site for me!</p>
                    <p> I'm interested in fun music opportunities near centeral Indiana, and connecting with more musicians locally and globally. I'd love to hear from you!</p>
