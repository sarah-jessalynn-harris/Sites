                <p> 2.	The Holy Bible is the Inspired Word of God. </p> 
                <p> 3.	The Virgin Mary was overshadowed by the Holy Ghost and Conceived Jesus, the only Begotten Son of God. </p>

                <p> 5.	God has provided one way for mankind to be forgiven of sin: repentance and faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
                <p> 6.	The Day of Pentecost provided the disbursement of the Holy Ghost to write God’s Moral Law, God’s code of right and wrong, on everyone’s heart. The Holy Ghost is the little voice of right reasoning in our conscience </p>
                <p> 7.	The Holy Spirit sheds light on sin and convicts our conscious so we may repent from sin turning to Jesus for forgiveness and sanctification. </p>
                <p> 8.	Once saved, all believers form the Body of Christ and the Church. </p>

                <p> 10.	Christians must strive to live an obedient life to Jesus Christ in our Homes, School, Jobs and Recreation. </p>
                <p> 11.	Church attendance is essencial for Spiritual and Moral development. </p>
                <p> 12.	Christian Marriage is a Holy Covenant made between a Man and a Woman under God's headship. </p>
                <p> 13.	Upon dying, the soul and spirit of the saved live with God for Eternity while the unsaved and wicked are eternally punished in Hell. </p>
                <p> 14. There will be a resurrection of the body for both the sinner and the saved to stand judgement before God, ending in condemnation for the sinner and everlasting life for the saved. </p>
