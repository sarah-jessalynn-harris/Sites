Located on N. Kitchen Rd. Mooresville, HHIC is a small, local church hoping to grow its members up in hopes of spreading God's word further and gathering more lost souls for God's harvest. We're a small church with a big heart! </p>

                <p> Harvest House International Church meets weekly on Sundays and Wednesdays to grow in fellowship and wisdom of God. Services are held at our church at 10089 N. Kitchen Rd. Mooresville, IN 46158. We hope to see you there!  </p>

                    <h3 class="sundae"> Sunday Service: 10:45 AM</h3>

                    <p> We hold a service each Sunday morning to commemorate the day Jesus arose. Prayer, worship, giving, and hearing an applicable message is a crucial part of our services. All are welcome each and every Sunday! </p> 

                    <p>We also hold a special service for children ages 3 - 19 in our Activity Building during the Pastor's message on Sunday mornings. However, on the final Sunday of the month, the entire congregation remains together in the Sanctuary to partake in communion.</p>

                    <h3> Wednesday Service: 6:45PM </h3>

                    <p> Our Wednesday evening services are very similar to those we hold on Sunday. The main difference is that on Wednesdays, we have much more in-depth Bible study. This service is designed to enrich people of all ages as well.</p>

                    <p> Opening Song & Prayer</p>
                    <p> Pledge, Honorarium, Offering</p>

                <h1> Local and Global Community Involvement </h1>
                
                <p> HHIC finds community involvement, both locally and globally, to be an important part of spreading God's word. We set 10% of the tithes and offerings aside weekly, with a goal of 50%, to be dedicated to community and international evangelism. Though we are an Independent Church, we have a worldwide vision of reaching the lost souls with the Gospel of Jesus.</p>

                <p> Locally, HHIC is honored to help support the efforts of local community missions such as the Mooresville Food Pantry and <span style = "font-style: italic"> Churches and Missions </span>, which provide food and utility assistance for hundreds of people in need every month.  </p>
                
                <p> Internationally, HHIC makes connections through <span style = "font-style: italic"> World Missions to Asia </span> which is dedicated to presenting the Gospel, training pastors, establishing church congregations, and repeating the process.  </p>

                <h1> Our Vision and Mission: <br>Convert - Disciple - Commission</h1>
                
                <p> HHIC was founded with a vision in mind. Though there were many wonderful churches in the area that one could choose from, the founding pastors felt called to create another church not to compete with other churches, but rather to complete the full gospel message using distinct teachings unique to the ministry.</p>
                
                <p> To do this, HHIC aims to grow the home church as well as work in nearby towns to propel the message further. </p>

                <h3> Behind the Name</h3>
                
                <p> The theme of Harvest was selected by HHIC because it was used by Jesus often to convey the idea of saving lost souls, one of the most important jobs assigned to the church. In a rural area such as Mooresville, this theme can be especially relatable as well. HHIC wishes to grow a good harvest of souls alongside the other crops our neighbors here raise. </p>
