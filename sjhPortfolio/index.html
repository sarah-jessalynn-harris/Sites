            <div class="text">
                <p>Hi there,</p>
                <p>My name is Sarah. Nice to meet you.</p>
                <p>I'm a zoomer who is proudly from The Middle of Nowhere, Indiana. I've always been interested in the creative arts and the growing world of technology. I have always done well in school, and after watching my family struggle with debt my whole life I knew I wanted to take that negative and turn it into a positive. I worked hard to get scholarships in order to go to college loan-free for a shot at a good career. This mixture of things lead me right into web development.</p>
                <p>In 2017 I enrolled into Indiana University Purdue University of Indianapolis to get my Bachelor's of Science in Media Arts and Science at the School of Informatics and Computing in 2021. I specialized in web design and development, and picked up a couple of minors in Computer Information Technology and Informatics as well. During this time I began my journey in web development and honed all the skills I have today.</p>
                <p>I now love working with front-end web development. I especially love creating web applications that are responsive for all devices. My go-to languages are HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy using many JS frameworks such as React as well as using Google's Firebase to work with data.  I'm really just happy to be developing whatever needs to be made. I love helping people get an online presence where their users can get things done.</p>

                <p>As a web developer, we need code to get the job done. The following languages and frameworks are what I have been using to create awesome websites and web apps.</p>

Sometimes you need help choosing a meal, keeping track of your ingredients, and making your shopping list. This application is built to have these all in one place.
