            <p class="text"> This classic game of memory is won by matching all the cards correctly. After you press the play button below, you will see a 4 x 4 row of cards. As you click on them, they will turn over to reveal what is on the underneath side. However, you can only click on two at a time. If they do not match, they will automatically flip back over for you after 1 second. If they are matching, they will automatically dissapear after half a second. Once you have matched all the cards, you may press the button to play a new round. Best of luck in finding your match! </p>
