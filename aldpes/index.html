            <p> Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma are joint honor societies at IUPUI. ALD/PES has a long history of coordinating community and campus volunteer projects, and providing several leadership opportunities to members. In addition, there are several scholarships and awards available to members.

            <p> To become eligible to join, you must earn a minimum of a 3.5 GPA and be in the top 20% of your class in your first semester of your freshman year at IUPUI. You will receive an invitation to join both societies via email in the early spring semester of your freshman year if you are eligible.

You will be able to attend our fun and informational meetings and activities while you're in college, and you will be a member of the scoieties for life.

            <h1> The Societies</h1>
            <p>Alpha Lambda Delta was a sorority founded in 1924 by the University of Illinois’s Dean of Women Maria Leonard. It was followed in 1926 by Phi Eta Sigma, a fraternity, founded by Dean Thomas Arkle Clark. After the passing of Title IX, a landmark amendment which prohibited sex discrimination in schools, ALD and PES joined to become a coed organization created to recognize the academic achievements of college freshmen. Our classic torch insignia is based on the quote “Will they hold torches and pass them to one another…" by Socrates, which was said at the first meeting of the joint chapter. The quote inspired many members and became an integral image of the ALD/PES identity.</p>
            <p>Indiana’s own Purdue and DePauw Universities were among the first out of state institutions to join, making the organization national. ALD/PES have been active members within the Association of College Honor Societies since the ACHS began, and now consists of over 260 chapters and more than 850,000 members nationwide. The ALD/PES mission is to “encourage superior academic achievement, to promote intelligent living and a high standard of learning, and to assist students in recognizing and developing meaningful goals in society." </p>

            <div class="groupPic"></div>

            <p> Our officers work diligently to plan meetings, community service events, and social gatherings. Last spring, past officers helped Lisa Ruch (our adviser) interview and select our current officers based on their skills in leadership, organization, and teamwork. Every August, all the officers meet at Eagle Creek Hide-A-Way to brainstorm ideas for the year. They continue to meet throughout the year to coordinate additional events. </p>
